# Authentication and User Roles

## User Types

### 1. SUPERADMIN
- Single user for the entire application
- Has full system access
- Can create QAUTHOR accounts
- Can manage all users and content
- Cannot be created through regular signup

### 2. QAUTHOR
- Created by SUPERADMIN only
- Can create and manage questions
- Can create and manage answers
- Cannot create other users
- Cannot access admin features

### 3. STUDENT
- Can sign up through regular registration
- Can view questions and answers
- Can track their progress
- Cannot create or modify content

## Authentication Flow

### SUPERADMIN Login
1. Initial SUPERADMIN credentials are set up during system initialization
2. SUPERADMIN can log in through the login button
3. SUPERADMIN can create QAUTHOR accounts from the admin dashboard

### QAUTHOR Creation
1. Only SUPERADMIN can create QAUTHOR accounts
2. QAUTHOR accounts are created with specific permissions
3. QAUTHORs receive their credentials from SUPERADMIN

### Student Registration
1. Any user can sign up as a STUDENT
2. Student accounts have limited permissions
3. Students can start using the system immediately after registration

## Security Notes
- SUPERADMIN credentials should be changed after initial setup
- QAUTHOR accounts should be created with strong passwords
- Student accounts have restricted access to protect system integrity

## Future Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Multi-factor authentication for SUPERADMIN
- Session management and timeout policies
- Password reset functionality
- Account recovery procedures
