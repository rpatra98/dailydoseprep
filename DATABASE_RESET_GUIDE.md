# Database Reset Guide - Daily Dose Prep

## Issue Summary

The application was experiencing login issues where users would get stuck after entering credentials. This was caused by several database and authentication flow problems.

## Pre-fix Issues Identified

### 1. **Database Schema Inconsistencies**
- Original schema had conflicting table definitions
- Migration files were adding columns that didn't align with the base schema
- RLS policies were incomplete or conflicting
- Orphaned auth users without corresponding user table entries

### 2. **Missing SUPERADMIN User**
- No proper SUPERADMIN user existed in the database
- The schema had a placeholder insert with invalid syntax
- Authentication system couldn't find user role information

### 3. **Authentication Flow Problems**
- Login would hang when trying to fetch user data
- No fallback mechanism for users existing in auth but not in users table
- Navigation logic was forcing redirects before data was properly loaded

### 4. **Supabase Client Configuration Issues**
- Browser client had incorrect initialization parameters
- Connection timeout issues
- Improper error handling during client setup

## Post-fix Behavior

### ‚úÖ **Clean Database State**
- All tables properly created with consistent schema
- Proper RLS policies in place
- SUPERADMIN user correctly configured
- Default subjects available

### ‚úÖ **Smooth Authentication Flow**
- Login works immediately with correct credentials
- Proper error handling for invalid credentials
- Automatic user record creation for orphaned auth users
- Proper navigation based on user roles

### ‚úÖ **Role-Based Access**
- SUPERADMIN: Full system access, can create QAUTHORs
- QAUTHOR: Can create and manage questions
- STUDENT: Can view and attempt questions

## How to Reset the Database

### Step 1: Run the Reset Script

```bash
npm run reset-db
```

This script will:
1. üßπ Delete all existing users from Supabase Auth
2. üóÇÔ∏è Drop all custom tables
3. üèóÔ∏è Create fresh database schema
4. üîÑ Apply all migrations
5. üëë Create SUPERADMIN user with specified credentials
6. üìö Add default subjects for testing

### Step 2: Verify the Reset

After running the script, you should see:

```
üéâ Database reset completed successfully!

üìã SUPERADMIN Credentials:
   Email: superadmin@ddp.com
   Password: 05tattva

‚ö†Ô∏è  Please change the password after first login for security!
```

### Step 3: Test the Login

1. Go to https://dailydoseprep.vercel.app/login
2. Use the SUPERADMIN credentials:
   - Email: `superadmin@ddp.com`
   - Password: `05tattva`
3. You should be redirected to the dashboard successfully

## SUPERADMIN Credentials

**Email:** `superadmin@ddp.com`  
**Password:** `05tattva`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** Change this password immediately after first login!

## What Was Fixed

- Fixed RLS policies

### 2. **Authentication Context (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
- Added robust error handling in login flow
- Implemented fallback user creation for orphaned auth users
- Removed premature navigation, letting useEffect handle redirects
- Improved timeout and retry logic

### 3. **Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabase-browser.ts`)**

- Improved connection testing
- Better error handling and retry logic

### 4. **Reset Script (`src/scripts/reset-database.js`)**
- Comprehensive database cleanup
- Proper SUPERADMIN user creation
- Default subjects setup
- Full verification process

## Database Structure After Reset

### Tables Created:
- `subjects` - Exam subjects (UPSC, JEE, NEET, SSC, etc.)
- `users` - User roles and information
- `questions` - MCQ questions with metadata
- `student_attempts` - Student answer tracking
- `daily_question_sets` - Daily question delivery system

### Default Subjects:
- General Studies (UPSC)
- Mathematics (JEE)
- Physics (JEE)
- Biology (NEET)
- General Knowledge (SSC)

### User Roles:
- **SUPERADMIN** - System administration
- **QAUTHOR** - Question creation and management
- **STUDENT** - Question practice and progress tracking

## Troubleshooting

### If Reset Fails:
1. Check your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
2. Ensure you have service role permissions
3. Check network connectivity to Supabase
4. Review console output for specific error messages

### If Login Still Fails:
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check browser developer console for errors
4. Verify the SUPERADMIN user was created in Supabase dashboard

### Environment Variables Required:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Next Steps After Reset

1. **Change SUPERADMIN Password**
   - Login with provided credentials
   - Update password in profile settings

2. **Create QAUTHOR Accounts**
   - Use SUPERADMIN dashboard to create QAUTHOR users
   - Provide credentials to question creators

3. **Add More Subjects**
   - SUPERADMIN can add/edit/delete subjects as needed

4. **Start Adding Questions**
   - QAUTHORs can begin creating questions
   - Questions will be available for students immediately
